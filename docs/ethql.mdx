# EthQL

## Background
EthQL is a modern API for Ethereum. Originally pioneered and open sourced at Facebook,
GraphQL is an efficient, extensible, and strongly typed API that is data is rooted
in graph relationships. You can learn more about GraphQL as a query language and specification
[here](https://graphql.org/). With EthQL, our aim is to replace JSON-RPC as the standard
interface into Ethereum

`EthQL = GraphQL + Ethereum`

## The Problem Statement
The JSON-RPC spec for Ethereum is vague in some areas and silent in others. This has led to
implementations filling in the blanks. As a spec focussed on simplicity and providing needed
functionality in an basic way, there is little room for extending JSON-RPC easily. There are paths
for upgrading the interface, but they ultimately lead to increasing complexity in implementation.

GraphQL provides a modern look on the problems that surface with JSON-RPC and other overlays we have
tried to stack on top of JSON-RPC such as REST. Built into its design are solutions for extending,
versioning, paging, validation, read, write, subscription semantics and much more. What follows are
more details around a fast developing space.

## Variants
In its current implementation, EthQL has 2 variants: [EthQL Standard](/ethql-standard) and
[EthQL Extended](/ethql-extended). The 2 variants have overlapping semantics and functionality.
While they exist as separate variants at this point, the goal is to merge them and have Extended
exist as a maleable overlay on top of Ethql Standard.
