# Getting Started

## Overview
Welcome to EthDenver Buidl with EthQL and [Infura](https://infura.io). Getting started with Ethql is easy.
Depending on how you want to build your application, there are a number of ways to get
started.

EthQL = Ethereum + GraphQL. The query language provides a schemaful, strongly typed,
graph relational api to Ethereum data. With a large ecosystem, developers can leverage
modern tooling to put together their DApps. Head to the [playground](https://ethql-denver.infura.io) and
start querying immediately. Want to get started buidling now? Follow the directions below to get up and running
fast!

## Full Decentral'd
If you already have an Ethereum client running (this could be geth, parity, or even
a local Truffle instance) follow these directions to get EthQL running locally.

Clone the git repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethql.git
```

`cd` into the directory
```
cd ethql
```

Start the EthQL server pointing to the url of the json-rpc.
```
yarn dev -j <your_server_url>
```
Merry Querying! :rocket:

## No Client; No problem
If you don't have a node running, but you still want to host EthQL on your local to integrate
into another backend, follow these directions to get EthQL running.

1. Go to https://infura.io and sign up for an account.
1. Create a New Project
1. Copy your project ID

Clone the git repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethql.git
```

`cd` into the directory
```
cd ethql
```

Start the EthQL Server using your INFURA_ID
```
INFURA_ID="<project_id>" yarn dev
```
Merry Querying! :rocket:

## Just let me buidl!
If you don't want to bother running any of it, no problem!

Head on over to Infura's [hosted EthQL](https://ethql-denver.infura.io) and start
playing with the GraphiQL playground, or point your client there to start querying.

Merry Querying! :rocket:
