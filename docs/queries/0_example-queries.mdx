* [Information on a single block](#information-on-a-single-block)
* [Information on transactions in a block](#information-on-transactions-in-a-block)
* [Information on a range of blocks](#information-on-a-range-of-blocks)
* [Information on an account](#information-on-an-account)
* [Information on a transaction](#information-on-a-transaction)

## Information on a single block
Fetch all transactions from the latest block, include the gas and gasUsed for the transaction and some information about the  to and from accounts.
```graphql
{
  block{
    number
    transactions {
      to {
        address
        transactionCount
      }
      from{
        address
        transactionCount
      }
      gas
      gasUsed
    }
  }
}

```

## Information on transactions in a block
Get contract and storage data for all transaction receivers in the latest block:
```graphql
{
  block {
    transactions {
      to{
        address
        balance
        transactionCount
        code
        storage(slot:"0x0")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Information on a range of blocks
For all blocks between 3831357 and 3831361 inclusive (5 blocks), get gas usage and get the balance of all addresses that sent a transaction.
```graphql
{
  blocks(from: 3831357, to: 3831361) {
    number
    timestamp
    gasUsed
    gasLimit
    transactions {
      from {

  }
}
```

## Information on an account

    address
    storage(slot: "0x0")
  }
}

```graphql
{
  transaction(hash:"0x3b32b8bd673bda2188cd79369e664d8b5576b12a111a6950449084fe9ef3f53a") {
