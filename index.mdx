# EthQL

## Background
EthQL is a modern API for the Ethereum network. Originally pioneered at Facebook
and open sourced, GraphQL is an efficient, extensible, and strongly typed API
that is based in the concept of graph data structures. You can learn more about
GraphQL as a query technology [here](https://graphql.org/).

## Variants
EthQL is a GraphQL implementation of Ethereum. In its current implementation,
EthQL exists in 2 forms: EthQL Standard and EthQL Extended. Both have advantages
and disadvantages in choosing which one to use. However, both relay on the power
of GraphQL to provide a modern development experience when developing a dAPP

## Which one is best
That all depends on what your use-case is and how you want to run EthQL. Both have
advantages and disadvantages as can be found in this documentation.
